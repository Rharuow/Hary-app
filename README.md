# Hary-app

## Goal

To show my web developer skills, this project has some of them. Here I'm applying basic concepts about javascript/typescript, React, NextJs,  SASS with BEM architecture, and Atomic classes.

This is a portfolio and a web app. Using Trello, cards with activities for features development are managed to organize the working flow, like Kanban of one man.

How to portfolio this project will show abilities with ReactJs and NextJS such as API consumption, dynamic routes, dynamic content, context API, and application of many famous libraries like Axios, react-hook-forms, tailwind, and bootstrap. About UX/UI abilities such as consistency, alignment, metaphors, and some other usabilities best practice applied.

All the assets were made by me using Figma software.
